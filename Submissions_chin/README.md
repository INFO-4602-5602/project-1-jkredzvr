Bell: Tooltips
** Sort of Done, need to change the placement of the coordinates*** 
Create a tooltip that shows the x- and y-value of each point when you hover over a point in the Part 3 scatterplot.


Bell: Xs and Ys
For your bar chart code, create a pair of bar charts for the active dataset: one coding the x-value and one coding the y-value of the current dataset. You can only receive credit for one of this and the “Coordinated Views” whistle.

Bell: Styling your Visualization
The visualization we’ve created here doesn’t have much pizzaz… Update the CSS stylesheet (project0.css) to restyle the visualization according to a central theme (e.g., 80’s neons, old world parchment, borrow ideas from an Instagram filter, etc.). Add a note in your readme.txt explaining the inspiration for your styling choices.

Bell: Best Fit Lines
For each scatterplot, compute and visualize a line of fit on top of each scatterplot in part 5. You should compute this line in your code rather than manually specifying the line of fit.


Whistle: Coordinated Views
Complete the “Xs and Ys” bell. Then, for each pair of charts, when you mouse over a bar in one graph, it should highlight that bar and the bar in the corresponding graph. For example, if you mouse over a bar representing an x-value, the corresponding y-value bar should also be highlighted. You can only receive credit for one of this and the “Xs and Ys” bell.
