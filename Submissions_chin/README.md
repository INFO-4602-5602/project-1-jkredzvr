Bell: Tooltips (DONE)
Create a tooltip that shows the x- and y-value of each point when you hover over a point in the Part 3 scatterplot.

Bell: Xs and Ys (DONE)
For your bar chart code, create a pair of bar charts for the active dataset: one coding the x-value and one coding the y-value of the current dataset. You can only receive credit for one of this and the “Coordinated Views” whistle.
